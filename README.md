This project scrapes basic information from Wikipedia pages and puts it into an easy to use format. This was designed for pages about famous persons though it can mostly be used for anything. Simply run bin/run and enter the url and follow the instructions. To utilize for multiple pages and compare similar information enter multiple urls and separate them with a comma and a space. This is currently workable prototype so feel free to offer input or let me know of any bugs that you encounter!
